 # What is F2C?
 
 Fog to cloud is an hybrid architecture mixing cloud and fog computing.
 This architecture try to solve common fast-solve problems without using the cloud as a first option.
 
 But, before all...
 
 **Cloud? What is it..** ü§î
 
 Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more over the Internet (*the cloud*) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources and economies of scale.
 
 Cloud has a lot of benefits, but... several limitations:
 + Latency
 + Limited bandwidth
 + Data protection mechanisms
 + Internet connectivity
 
 Here is where **Fog** comes to the rescue...
 
 **Fog computing**
 
 Fog computing has emerged as a novel and challenging technology intended to complement the features of the cloud computing paradigm by exploiting the opportunities of locality. Moving some computation to the edge of the network is especially attractive in a smart city scenario, where a vast network of heterogeneous resources is widely distributed all over the city.
 
 What fog benefits has?
 + Low latency
 + Geo-distribution
 + Very low delay jitters
 + Suport for mobility
 + Location awareness
 + Real-time interactions
 
 Well, well, well... imagine these two technologies working together having the best benefits of each one,  sound amazing right? üòã
 
 Welcome to **F2C computing**! üëãüèº
 
 You're introduced in a new world, a new paradigm, a new way of compute things...
 
 This playground pretends to show you how **F2C** is structured and how is connected under the hood. There's no better way to do it than showing you graphically.
 When you will be ready to see what **F2C** hides, please, go to [next page](@next) ü§Ø!

 To see a simplest **F2C** architecture, look the graph on the right side and play with it. You can drag and rotate the graph.
