 # One more thing...
 It's cool play with graphs and learn new things every day. For this reason I created random *F2C* generator. This tool allows to create a bunch of different kind of scenarios.
 
 Inasmuch as the live view screen size is small, I only allow a limited number of nodes, but you could use the core in a iOS/mac app and display the number of nodes that you want.
 
 To use the tool, just press 🔄. A new random scenario will be generated 😏.
 
 # Thanks 🤗
 Thank you so much for using this playground. I hope you enjoyed as same as I did it in this challenge.
 *F2C* is what I'm researching in a PhD group. We are focused on try to create and made this technology available in the near years to everyone.
 When I started to research about this technology everything sounded strange to me, but now... I only think in how I can help to create it, because we can help people and this is really important for me.
 This was the purpose of this playground, bring to people the knowledge that I learned during the last year and show that not only cloud computing exists in the world but could work fine with completly different architectures.
 
 Joan.
